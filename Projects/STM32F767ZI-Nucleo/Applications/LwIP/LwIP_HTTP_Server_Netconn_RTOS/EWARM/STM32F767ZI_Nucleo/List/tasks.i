 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, then FILE descriptors and related functions
 * (e.g. fprintf, fopen) does not exist. All functions that normally uses

 *
 * Default is to use a static 80 byte buffer.
 */



/*
 * Support of locale interface
 *
 * "Locale" is the system in C that support language- and
 * contry-specific settings for a number of areas, including currency
 * symbols, date and time, and multibyte encodings.
 *
 * This setting determines whether the locale interface exist or not.
 * When this feature is selected, i.e. set to 1, the locale interface exist
 * (setlocale, etc). A number of preselected locales can be activated during
 * runtime. The preselected locales and encodings are choosen at linkage. The
 * application will start with the "C" locale choosen. (Single byte encoding is
 * always supported in this mode.)
 *
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, the locale interface (setlocale, etc) does
 * not exist. The C locale is then preset and cannot be changed.
 *
 * The default is not to have support for the locale interface with the "C"

 *
 * This setting controls if 'int' should be used internally in printf, rather
 * than the largest existing integer type. If 'int' is used, any integer or
 * pointer type formatting use 'int' as internal type even though the
 * formatted type is larger. Set to 1 to use 'int' as internal type, otherwise

/*
 * Emit a char a time in printf
 *
 * This setting controls internal output handling. If selected, i.e. set to 1,
 * then printf emits one character at a time, which requires less code but
 * can be slightly slower for some types of output.
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, then printf buffers some outputs.
 *
 * Note that it is recommended to either use full file support (see
 * _DLIB_FILE_DESCRIPTOR) or -- for debug output -- use the linker
 * option "-e__write_buffered=__write" to enable buffered I/O rather
 * than deselecting this feature.

 * not change over the data models used, but the placement of data variables
 * or/and constant variables do.
 *
 * If defined, this symbol is typically defined to the memory attribute that
 * is used by the runtime library. The actual define must use a

/*
 * This is the list implementation used by the scheduler.  While it is tailored
 * heavily for the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by
 * application code.
 *
 * list_ts can only store pointers to list_item_ts.  Each ListItem_t contains a
 * numeric value (xItemValue).  Most of the time the lists are sorted in
 * descending item value order.
 *
 * Lists are created already containing one list item.  The value of this
 * item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
 * the end of the list and acts as a marker.  The list member pxHead always
 * points to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list.  This
 * is because the tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of
 * the list.
 *
 * In addition to it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next
 * item in the list (pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer)
 * and a pointer to back to the object that contains it.  These later two
 * pointers are included for efficiency of list manipulation.  There is
 * effectively a two way link between the object containing the list item and
 * the list item itself.

/*
 * The list structure members are modified from within interrupts, and therefore
 * by rights should be declared volatile.  However, they are only modified in a
 * functionally atomic way (within critical sections of with the scheduler
 * suspended) and are either passed by reference into a function or indexed via
 * a volatile variable.  Therefore, in all use cases tested so far, the volatile
 * qualifier can be omitted in order to provide a moderate performance
 * improvement without adversely affecting functional behaviour.  The assembly
 * instructions generated by the IAR, ARM and GCC compilers when the respective
 * compiler's options were set for maximum optimisation has been inspected and
 * deemed to be as intended.  That said, as compiler technology advances, and
 * especially if aggressive cross module optimisation is used (a use case that
 * has not been exercised to any great extend) then it is feasible that the
 * volatile qualifier will be needed for correct optimisation.  It is expected
 * that a compiler removing essential code because, without the volatile
 * qualifier on the list structure members and with aggressive cross module
 * optimisation, the compiler deemed the code unnecessary will result in
 * complete and obvious failure of the scheduler.  If this is ever experienced
 * then the volatile qualifier can be inserted in the relevant places within the
 * list structures by simply defining configLIST_VOLATILE to volatile in
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (as per the example at the bottom of this comment block).
 * If configLIST_VOLATILE is not defined then the preprocessor directives below
 * will simply #define configLIST_VOLATILE away completely.
 *
 * To use volatile list structure members then add the following line to
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (without the quotes):

 * 								TimerCallbackFunction_t pxCallbackFunction );
 *
 * Creates a new software timer instance, and returns a handle by which the
 * created software timer can be referenced.
 *
 * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, software timers use a block
 * of memory, in which the timer data structure is stored.  If a software timer
 * is created using xTimerCreate() then the required memory is automatically
 * dynamically allocated inside the xTimerCreate() function.  (see
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a software timer is created using
 * xTimerCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the memory that
 * will get used by the software timer.  xTimerCreateStatic() therefore allows a
 * software timer to be created without using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * Timers are created in the dormant state.  The xTimerStart(), xTimerReset(),
 * xTimerStartFromISR(), xTimerResetFromISR(), xTimerChangePeriod() and
 * xTimerChangePeriodFromISR() API functions can all be used to transition a
 * timer into the active state.
 *
 * @param pcTimerName A text name that is assigned to the timer.  This is done
 * purely to assist debugging.  The kernel itself only ever references a timer
 * by its handle, and never by its name.
 *
 * @param xTimerPeriodInTicks The timer period.  The time is defined in tick
 * periods so the constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to convert a time that
 * has been specified in milliseconds.  For example, if the timer must expire
 * after 100 ticks, then xTimerPeriodInTicks should be set to 100.
 * Alternatively, if the timer must expire after 500ms, then xPeriod can be set
 * to ( 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS ) provided configTICK_RATE_HZ is less than or
 * equal to 1000.
 *
 * @param uxAutoReload If uxAutoReload is set to pdTRUE then the timer will
 * expire repeatedly with a frequency set by the xTimerPeriodInTicks parameter.
 * If uxAutoReload is set to pdFALSE then the timer will be a one-shot timer and
 * enter the dormant state after it expires.
 *
 * @param pvTimerID An identifier that is assigned to the timer being created.
 * Typically this would be used in the timer callback function to identify which
 * timer expired when the same callback function is assigned to more than one
 * timer.
 *
 * @param pxCallbackFunction The function to call when the timer expires.
 * Callback functions must have the prototype defined by TimerCallbackFunction_t,
 * which is	"void vCallbackFunction( TimerHandle_t xTimer );".
 *
 * @return If the timer is successfully created then a handle to the newly
 * created timer is returned.  If the timer cannot be created (because either
 * there is insufficient FreeRTOS heap remaining to allocate the timer
 * structures, or the timer period was set to 0) then NULL is returned.
 *

 *
 * // Define a callback function that will be used by multiple timer instances.
 * // The callback function does nothing but count the number of times the
 * // associated timer expires, and stop the timer once the timer has expired
 * // 10 times.
 * void vTimerCallback( TimerHandle_t pxTimer )

 *     lArrayIndex = ( int32_t ) pvTimerGetTimerID( pxTimer );
 *
 *     // Increment the number of times that pxTimer has expired.
 *     lExpireCounters[ lArrayIndex ] += 1;
 *
 *     // If the timer has expired 10 times then stop it from running.
 *     if( lExpireCounters[ lArrayIndex ] == xMaxExpiryCountBeforeStopping )

 * Used from application interrupt service routines to defer the execution of a
 * function to the RTOS daemon task (the timer service task, hence this function
 * is implemented in timers.c and is prefixed with 'Timer').
 *
 * Ideally an interrupt service routine (ISR) is kept as short as possible, but
 * sometimes an ISR either has a lot of processing to do, or needs to perform
 * processing that is not deterministic.  In these cases
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR() can be used to defer processing of a function
 * to the RTOS daemon task.
 *
 * A mechanism is provided that allows the interrupt to return directly to the
 * task that will subsequently execute the pended callback function.  This
 * allows the callback function to execute contiguously in time with the
 * interrupt - just as if the callback had executed in the interrupt itself.
 *
 * @param xFunctionToPend The function to execute from the timer service/
 * daemon task.  The function must conform to the PendedFunction_t
 * prototype.
 *
 * @param pvParameter1 The value of the callback function's first parameter.
 * The parameter has a void * type to allow it to be used to pass any type.
 * For example, unsigned longs can be cast to a void *, or the void * can be
 * used to point to a structure.
 *
 * @param ulParameter2 The value of the callback function's second parameter.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken As mentioned above, calling this function
 * will result in a message being sent to the timer daemon task.  If the
 * priority of the timer daemon task (which is set using
 * configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY in FreeRTOSConfig.h) is higher than the priority of
 * the currently running task (the task the interrupt interrupted) then
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken will be set to pdTRUE within
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR(), indicating that a context switch should be
 * requested before the interrupt exits.  For that reason
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken must be initialised to pdFALSE.  See the
 * example code below.
 *
 * @return pdPASS is returned if the message was successfully sent to the
 * timer daemon task, otherwise pdFALSE is returned.
