 *
 * Default is to use a static 80 byte buffer.
 */

 * Support of locale interface
 *
 * "Locale" is the system in C that support language- and
 * contry-specific settings for a number of areas, including currency
 * symbols, date and time, and multibyte encodings.
 *
 * This setting determines whether the locale interface exist or not.
 * When this feature is selected, i.e. set to 1, the locale interface exist
 * (setlocale, etc). A number of preselected locales can be activated during
 * runtime. The preselected locales and encodings are choosen at linkage. The
 * application will start with the "C" locale choosen. (Single byte encoding is
 * always supported in this mode.)
 *
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, the locale interface (setlocale, etc) does
 * not exist. The C locale is then preset and cannot be changed.

/* Each FreeRTOS port has a unique portmacro.h header file.  Originally a
pre-processor definition was used to ensure the pre-processor found the correct
portmacro.h file for the port being used.  That scheme was deprecated in favour
of setting the compiler's include path such that it found the correct
portmacro.h file - removing the need for the constant and allowing the
portmacro.h file to be located anywhere in relation to the port being used.
Purely for reasons of backward compatibility the old method is still valid, but
to make it clear that new projects should not use it, support for the port
specific constants has been moved into the deprecated_definitions.h header
file. */

/* Each FreeRTOS port has a unique portmacro.h header file.  Originally a
pre-processor definition was used to ensure the pre-processor found the correct
portmacro.h file for the port being used.  That scheme was deprecated in favour
of setting the compiler's include path such that it found the correct
portmacro.h file - removing the need for the constant and allowing the
portmacro.h file to be located anywhere in relation to the port being used.  The
definitions below remain in the code for backward compatibility only.  New
projects should not use them. */



























































/* If portENTER_CRITICAL is not defined then including deprecated_definitions.h
did not result in a portmacro.h header file being included - and it should be
included here.  In this case the path to the correct portmacro.h header file
must be set in the compiler's include path. */

 * This is the list implementation used by the scheduler.  While it is tailored
 * heavily for the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by
 * application code.
 *
 * list_ts can only store pointers to list_item_ts.  Each ListItem_t contains a
 * numeric value (xItemValue).  Most of the time the lists are sorted in
 * descending item value order.
 *
 * Lists are created already containing one list item.  The value of this
 * item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
 * the end of the list and acts as a marker.  The list member pxHead always
 * points to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list.  This
 * is because the tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of
 * the list.
 *
 * In addition to it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next
 * item in the list (pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer)
 * and a pointer to back to the object that contains it.  These later two
 * pointers are included for efficiency of list manipulation.  There is
 * effectively a two way link between the object containing the list item and
 * the list item itself.

/*
 * The list structure members are modified from within interrupts, and therefore
 * by rights should be declared volatile.  However, they are only modified in a
 * functionally atomic way (within critical sections of with the scheduler
 * suspended) and are either passed by reference into a function or indexed via
 * a volatile variable.  Therefore, in all use cases tested so far, the volatile
 * qualifier can be omitted in order to provide a moderate performance
 * improvement without adversely affecting functional behaviour.  The assembly
 * instructions generated by the IAR, ARM and GCC compilers when the respective
 * compiler's options were set for maximum optimisation has been inspected and
 * deemed to be as intended.  That said, as compiler technology advances, and
 * especially if aggressive cross module optimisation is used (a use case that
 * has not been exercised to any great extend) then it is feasible that the
 * volatile qualifier will be needed for correct optimisation.  It is expected
 * that a compiler removing essential code because, without the volatile
 * qualifier on the list structure members and with aggressive cross module
 * optimisation, the compiler deemed the code unnecessary will result in
 * complete and obvious failure of the scheduler.  If this is ever experienced
 * then the volatile qualifier can be inserted in the relevant places within the
 * list structures by simply defining configLIST_VOLATILE to volatile in
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (as per the example at the bottom of this comment block).
 * If configLIST_VOLATILE is not defined then the preprocessor directives below
 * will simply #define configLIST_VOLATILE away completely.

 * Create a new task and add it to the list of tasks that are ready to run.
 *
 * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, tasks use two blocks of
 * memory.  The first block is used to hold the task's data structures.  The
 * second block is used by the task as its stack.  If a task is created using
 * xTaskCreate() then both blocks of memory are automatically dynamically
 * allocated inside the xTaskCreate() function.  (see
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a task is created using
 * xTaskCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the required
 * memory.  xTaskCreateStatic() therefore allows a task to be created without
 * using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * See xTaskCreateStatic() for a version that does not use any dynamic memory
 * allocation.
 *
 * xTaskCreate() can only be used to create a task that has unrestricted
 * access to the entire microcontroller memory map.  Systems that include MPU
 * support can alternatively create an MPU constrained task using
 * xTaskCreateRestricted().
 *

 * must be implemented to never return (i.e. continuous loop).
 *
 * @param pcName A descriptive name for the task.  This is mainly used to
 * facilitate debugging.  Max length defined by configMAX_TASK_NAME_LEN - default
 * is 16.
 *
 * @param usStackDepth The size of the task stack specified as the number of
 * variables the stack can hold - not the number of bytes.  For example, if
 * the stack is 16 bits wide and usStackDepth is defined as 100, 200 bytes
 * will be allocated for stack storage.
 *
 * @param pvParameters Pointer that will be used as the parameter for the task
 * being created.
 *
 * @param uxPriority The priority at which the task should run.  Systems that
 * include MPU support can optionally create tasks in a privileged (system)
 * mode by setting bit portPRIVILEGE_BIT of the priority parameter.  For
 * example, to create a privileged task at priority 2 the uxPriority parameter
 * should be set to ( 2 | portPRIVILEGE_BIT ).

 * task. h
 * <pre>void vTaskDelay( const TickType_t xTicksToDelay );</pre>
 *
 * Delay a task for a given number of ticks.  The actual time that the
 * task remains blocked depends on the tick rate.  The constant
 * portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * INCLUDE_vTaskDelay must be defined as 1 for this function to be available.
 * See the configuration section for more information.
 *
 *
 * vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock relative to
 * the time at which vTaskDelay() is called.  For example, specifying a block
 * period of 100 ticks will cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after
 * vTaskDelay() is called.  vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good method
 * of controlling the frequency of a periodic task as the path taken through the
 * code, as well as other task and interrupt activity, will effect the frequency
 * at which vTaskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the task
 * next executes.  See vTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative API function designed
 * to facilitate fixed frequency execution.  It does this by specifying an
 * absolute time (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task should
 * unblock.
 *
 * @param xTicksToDelay The amount of time, in tick periods, that
 * the calling task should block.
 *
 * Example usage:

 void vTaskFunction( void * pvParameters )

 * See the configuration section for more information.
 *
 * Delay a task until a specified time.  This function can be used by periodic
 * tasks to ensure a constant execution frequency.
 *
 * This function differs from vTaskDelay () in one important aspect:  vTaskDelay () will
 * cause a task to block for the specified number of ticks from the time vTaskDelay () is
 * called.  It is therefore difficult to use vTaskDelay () by itself to generate a fixed
 * execution frequency as the time between a task starting to execute and that task
 * calling vTaskDelay () may not be fixed [the task may take a different path though the
 * code between calls, or may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
 * each time it executes].
 *
 * Whereas vTaskDelay () specifies a wake time relative to the time at which the function
 * is called, vTaskDelayUntil () specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
 * unblock.
 *
 * The constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * @param pxPreviousWakeTime Pointer to a variable that holds the time at which the
 * task was last unblocked.  The variable must be initialised with the current time

 * automatically updated within vTaskDelayUntil ().
 *
 * @param xTimeIncrement The cycle time period.  The task will be unblocked at
 * time *pxPreviousWakeTime + xTimeIncrement.  Calling vTaskDelayUntil with the
 * same xTimeIncrement parameter value will cause the task to execute with
 * a fixed interface period.

 * NOTE:  This function is intended for debugging use only as its use results in

 *
 * @param pxTaskStatusArray A pointer to an array of TaskStatus_t structures.
 * The array must contain at least one TaskStatus_t structure for each task
 * that is under the control of the RTOS.  The number of tasks under the control
 * of the RTOS can be determined using the uxTaskGetNumberOfTasks() API function.
 *
 * @param uxArraySize The size of the array pointed to by the pxTaskStatusArray
 * parameter.  The size is specified as the number of indexes in the array, or
 * the number of TaskStatus_t structures contained in the array, not by the
 * number of bytes in the array.
 *
 * @param pulTotalRunTime If configGENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS is set to 1 in
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h then *pulTotalRunTime is set by uxTaskGetSystemState() to the
 * total run time (as defined by the run time stats clock, see
 * http://www.freertos.org/rtos-run-time-stats.html) since the target booted.
 * pulTotalRunTime can be set to NULL to omit the total run time information.
 *
 * @return The number of TaskStatus_t structures that were populated by
 * uxTaskGetSystemState().  This should equal the number returned by the
 * uxTaskGetNumberOfTasks() API function, but will be zero if the value passed
 * in the uxArraySize parameter was too small.
 *

		// function is executing.
		uxArraySize = uxTaskGetNumberOfTasks();

		// Allocate a TaskStatus_t structure for each task.  An array could be
		// allocated statically at compile time.

					// This will always be rounded down to the nearest integer.
					// ulTotalRunTimeDiv100 has already been divided by 100.

 *
 * Creates a new software timer instance, and returns a handle by which the
 * created software timer can be referenced.
 *
 * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, software timers use a block
 * of memory, in which the timer data structure is stored.  If a software timer
 * is created using xTimerCreate() then the required memory is automatically
 * dynamically allocated inside the xTimerCreate() function.  (see
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a software timer is created using
 * xTimerCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the memory that
 * will get used by the software timer.  xTimerCreateStatic() therefore allows a
 * software timer to be created without using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * Timers are created in the dormant state.  The xTimerStart(), xTimerReset(),
 * xTimerStartFromISR(), xTimerResetFromISR(), xTimerChangePeriod() and
 * xTimerChangePeriodFromISR() API functions can all be used to transition a
 * timer into the active state.
 *
 * @param pcTimerName A text name that is assigned to the timer.  This is done
 * purely to assist debugging.  The kernel itself only ever references a timer
 * by its handle, and never by its name.
 *
 * @param xTimerPeriodInTicks The timer period.  The time is defined in tick
 * periods so the constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to convert a time that
 * has been specified in milliseconds.  For example, if the timer must expire
 * after 100 ticks, then xTimerPeriodInTicks should be set to 100.
 * Alternatively, if the timer must expire after 500ms, then xPeriod can be set
 * to ( 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS ) provided configTICK_RATE_HZ is less than or
 * equal to 1000.
 *
 * @param uxAutoReload If uxAutoReload is set to pdTRUE then the timer will
 * expire repeatedly with a frequency set by the xTimerPeriodInTicks parameter.
 * If uxAutoReload is set to pdFALSE then the timer will be a one-shot timer and
 * enter the dormant state after it expires.
 *
 * @param pvTimerID An identifier that is assigned to the timer being created.
 * Typically this would be used in the timer callback function to identify which
 * timer expired when the same callback function is assigned to more than one
 * timer.
 *
 * @param pxCallbackFunction The function to call when the timer expires.
 * Callback functions must have the prototype defined by TimerCallbackFunction_t,
 * which is	"void vCallbackFunction( TimerHandle_t xTimer );".
 *
 * @return If the timer is successfully created then a handle to the newly
 * created timer is returned.  If the timer cannot be created (because either
 * there is insufficient FreeRTOS heap remaining to allocate the timer
 * structures, or the timer period was set to 0) then NULL is returned.

 *
 * A version of xTimerReset() that can be called from an interrupt service
 * routine.
 *
 * @param xTimer The handle of the timer that is to be started, reset, or
 * restarted.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken The timer service/daemon task spends most
 * of its time in the Blocked state, waiting for messages to arrive on the timer
 * command queue.  Calling xTimerResetFromISR() writes a message to the timer
 * command queue, so has the potential to transition the timer service/daemon
 * task out of the Blocked state.  If calling xTimerResetFromISR() causes the
 * timer service/daemon task to leave the Blocked state, and the timer service/
 * daemon task has a priority equal to or greater than the currently executing
 * task (the task that was interrupted), then *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken will
 * get set to pdTRUE internally within the xTimerResetFromISR() function.  If
 * xTimerResetFromISR() sets this value to pdTRUE then a context switch should
 * be performed before the interrupt exits.
 *
 * @return pdFAIL will be returned if the reset command could not be sent to
 * the timer command queue.  pdPASS will be returned if the command was
 * successfully sent to the timer command queue.  When the command is actually
 * processed will depend on the priority of the timer service/daemon task
 * relative to other tasks in the system, although the timers expiry time is
 * relative to when xTimerResetFromISR() is actually called.  The timer service/daemon
 * task priority is set by the configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY configuration constant.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @verbatim

 *
 *
 * Used from application interrupt service routines to defer the execution of a
 * function to the RTOS daemon task (the timer service task, hence this function
 * is implemented in timers.c and is prefixed with 'Timer').
 *
 * Ideally an interrupt service routine (ISR) is kept as short as possible, but
 * sometimes an ISR either has a lot of processing to do, or needs to perform
 * processing that is not deterministic.  In these cases
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR() can be used to defer processing of a function
 * to the RTOS daemon task.
 *
 * A mechanism is provided that allows the interrupt to return directly to the
 * task that will subsequently execute the pended callback function.  This
 * allows the callback function to execute contiguously in time with the
 * interrupt - just as if the callback had executed in the interrupt itself.
 *
 * @param xFunctionToPend The function to execute from the timer service/
 * daemon task.  The function must conform to the PendedFunction_t
 * prototype.
 *
 * @param pvParameter1 The value of the callback function's first parameter.
 * The parameter has a void * type to allow it to be used to pass any type.
 * For example, unsigned longs can be cast to a void *, or the void * can be
 * used to point to a structure.
 *
 * @param ulParameter2 The value of the callback function's second parameter.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken As mentioned above, calling this function
 * will result in a message being sent to the timer daemon task.  If the
 * priority of the timer daemon task (which is set using
 * configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY in FreeRTOSConfig.h) is higher than the priority of
 * the currently running task (the task the interrupt interrupted) then
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken will be set to pdTRUE within
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR(), indicating that a context switch should be
 * requested before the interrupt exits.  For that reason
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken must be initialised to pdFALSE.  See the
 * example code below.
 *
 * @return pdPASS is returned if the message was successfully sent to the
 * timer daemon task, otherwise pdFALSE is returned.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @verbatim
 *
 *	// The callback function that will execute in the context of the daemon task.
 *  // Note callback functions must all use this same prototype.
 *  void vProcessInterface( void *pvParameter1, uint32_t ulParameter2 )
 *	{
 *		BaseType_t xInterfaceToService;
 *
 *		// The interface that requires servicing is passed in the second
 *      // parameter.  The first parameter is not used in this case.
 *		xInterfaceToService = ( BaseType_t ) ulParameter2;
 *
 *		// ...Perform the processing here...
 *	}
 *
 *	// An ISR that receives data packets from multiple interfaces
 *  void vAnISR( void )
 *	{
 *		BaseType_t xInterfaceToService, xHigherPriorityTaskWoken;
 *
 *		// Query the hardware to determine which interface needs processing.
 *		xInterfaceToService = prvCheckInterfaces();
 *
 *      // The actual processing is to be deferred to a task.  Request the
 *      // vProcessInterface() callback function is executed, passing in the
 *		// number of the interface that needs processing.  The interface to
 *		// service is passed in the second parameter.  The first parameter is
 *		// not used in this case.
 *		xHigherPriorityTaskWoken = pdFALSE;
 *		xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR( vProcessInterface, NULL, ( uint32_t ) xInterfaceToService, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
 *
 *		// If xHigherPriorityTaskWoken is now set to pdTRUE then a context

 *
 * A version of xQueueOverwrite() that can be used in an interrupt service

 *
 * Only for use with queues that can hold a single item - so the queue is either
 * empty or full.
 *
 * Post an item on a queue.  If the queue is already full then overwrite the
 * value held in the queue.  The item is queued by copy, not by reference.
 *
 * @param xQueue The handle to the queue on which the item is to be posted.
 *
 * @param pvItemToQueue A pointer to the item that is to be placed on the
 * queue.  The size of the items the queue will hold was defined when the
 * queue was created, so this many bytes will be copied from pvItemToQueue
 * into the queue storage area.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken xQueueOverwriteFromISR() will set
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken to pdTRUE if sending to the queue caused a task
 * to unblock, and the unblocked task has a priority higher than the currently
 * running task.  If xQueueOverwriteFromISR() sets this value to pdTRUE then
 * a context switch should be requested before the interrupt is exited.
 *
 * @return xQueueOverwriteFromISR() is a macro that calls
 * xQueueGenericSendFromISR(), and therefore has the same return values as
 * xQueueSendToFrontFromISR().  However, pdPASS is the only value that can be
 * returned because xQueueOverwriteFromISR() will write to the queue even when

 * Queue sets provide a mechanism to allow a task to block (pend) on a read
 * operation from multiple queues or semaphores simultaneously.
 *
 * See FreeRTOS/Source/Demo/Common/Minimal/QueueSet.c for an example using this
 * function.
 *
 * A queue set must be explicitly created using a call to xQueueCreateSet()
 * before it can be used.  Once created, standard FreeRTOS queues and semaphores
 * can be added to the set using calls to xQueueAddToSet().
 * xQueueSelectFromSet() is then used to determine which, if any, of the queues
 * or semaphores contained in the set is in a state where a queue read or
 * semaphore take operation would be successful.
 *
 * Note 1:  See the documentation on http://wwwFreeRTOS.org/RTOS-queue-sets.html
 * for reasons why queue sets are very rarely needed in practice as there are
 * simpler methods of blocking on multiple objects.
 *
 * Note 2:  Blocking on a queue set that contains a mutex will not cause the
 * mutex holder to inherit the priority of the blocked task.
 *
 * Note 3:  An additional 4 bytes of RAM is required for each space in a every
 * queue added to a queue set.  Therefore counting semaphores that have a high
 * maximum count value should not be added to a queue set.
 *
 * Note 4:  A receive (in the case of a queue) or take (in the case of a
 * semaphore) operation must not be performed on a member of a queue set unless
 * a call to xQueueSelectFromSet() has first returned a handle to that set member.
 *
 * @param uxEventQueueLength Queue sets store events that occur on
 * the queues and semaphores contained in the set.  uxEventQueueLength specifies
 * the maximum number of events that can be queued at once.  To be absolutely
 * certain that events are not lost uxEventQueueLength should be set to the
 * total sum of the length of the queues added to the set, where binary
 * semaphores and mutexes have a length of 1, and counting semaphores have a
 * length set by their maximum count value.  Examples:
 *  + If a queue set is to hold a queue of length 5, another queue of length 12,
 *    and a binary semaphore, then uxEventQueueLength should be set to
 *    (5 + 12 + 1), or 18.
 *  + If a queue set is to hold three binary semaphores then uxEventQueueLength
 *    should be set to (1 + 1 + 1 ), or 3.
 *  + If a queue set is to hold a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of
 *    5, and a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of 3, then
 *    uxEventQueueLength should be set to (5 + 3), or 8.

 * Counting semaphores are typically used for two things:

 *
 * 2) Resource management.
 *
 *    In this usage scenario the count value indicates the number of resources
 *    available.  To obtain control of a resource a task must first obtain a

/**
 * An event group is a collection of bits to which an application can assign a
 * meaning.  For example, an application may create an event group to convey
 * the status of various CAN bus related events in which bit 0 might mean "A CAN
 * message has been received and is ready for processing", bit 1 might mean "The
 * application has queued a message that is ready for sending onto the CAN
 * network", and bit 2 might mean "It is time to send a SYNC message onto the
 * CAN network" etc.  A task can then test the bit values to see which events
 * are active, and optionally enter the Blocked state to wait for a specified
 * bit or a group of specified bits to be active.  To continue the CAN bus
 * example, a CAN controlling task can enter the Blocked state (and therefore
 * not consume any processing time) until either bit 0, bit 1 or bit 2 are
 * active, at which time the bit that was actually active would inform the task
 * which action it had to take (process a received message, send a message, or
 * send a SYNC).
 *
 * The event groups implementation contains intelligence to avoid race
 * conditions that would otherwise occur were an application to use a simple
 * variable for the same purpose.  This is particularly important with respect
 * to when a bit within an event group is to be cleared, and when bits have to
 * be set and then tested atomically - as is the case where event groups are
 * used to create a synchronisation point between multiple tasks (a

/**
\page cmsis_os_h Header File Template: cmsis_os.h

The file \b cmsis_os.h is a template header file for a CMSIS-RTOS compliant Real-Time Operating System (RTOS).
Each RTOS that is compliant with CMSIS-RTOS shall provide a specific \b cmsis_os.h header file that represents
its implementation.

The file cmsis_os.h contains:
 - CMSIS-RTOS API function definitions
 - struct definitions for parameters and return types
 - status and priority values used by CMSIS-RTOS API functions
 - macros for defining threads and other kernel objects


<b>Name conventions and header file modifications</b>

All definitions are prefixed with \b os to give an unique name space for CMSIS-RTOS functions.
Definitions that are prefixed \b os_ are not used in the application code but local to this header file.
All definitions and functions that belong to a module are grouped and have a common prefix, i.e. \b osThread.

Definitions that are marked with <b>CAN BE CHANGED</b> can be adapted towards the needs of the actual CMSIS-RTOS implementation.
These definitions can be specific to the underlying RTOS kernel.

Definitions that are marked with <b>MUST REMAIN UNCHANGED</b> cannot be altered. Otherwise the CMSIS-RTOS implementation is no longer
compliant to the standard. Note that some functions are optional and need not to be provided by every CMSIS-RTOS implementation.


<b>Function calls from interrupt service routines</b>

The following CMSIS-RTOS functions can be called from threads and interrupt service routines (ISR):
  - \ref osSignalSet
  - \ref osSemaphoreRelease
  - \ref osPoolAlloc, \ref osPoolCAlloc, \ref osPoolFree
  - \ref osMessagePut, \ref osMessageGet
  - \ref osMailAlloc, \ref osMailCAlloc, \ref osMailGet, \ref osMailPut, \ref osMailFree

Functions that cannot be called from an ISR are verifying the interrupt status and return in case that they are called
from an ISR context the status code \b osErrorISR. In some implementations this condition might be caught using the HARD FAULT vector.

Some CMSIS-RTOS implementations support CMSIS-RTOS function calls from multiple ISR at the same time.
If this is impossible, the CMSIS-RTOS rejects calls by nested ISR functions with the status code \b osErrorISRRecursive.


<b>Define and reference object definitions</b>

With <b>\#define osObjectsExternal</b> objects are defined as external symbols. This allows to create a consistent header file
that is used throughout a project as shown below:

<i>Header File</i>
\code
#include <cmsis_os.h>                                         // CMSIS RTOS header file

// Thread definition
extern void thread_sample (void const *argument);             // function prototype
osThreadDef (thread_sample, osPriorityBelowNormal, 1, 100);

// Pool definition
osPoolDef(MyPool, 10, long);
\endcode


This header file defines all objects when included in a C/C++ source file. When <b>\#define osObjectsExternal</b> is
present before the header file, the objects are defined as external symbols. A single consistent header file can therefore be
used throughout the whole project.

<i>Example</i>
\code
#include "osObjects.h"     // Definition of the CMSIS-RTOS objects
\endcode

\code
#define osObjectExternal   // Objects will be defined as external symbols
#include "osObjects.h"     // Reference to the CMSIS-RTOS objects
\endcode

 * 
 * In the netconn implementation, there are three ways to block a client:
 * 
 * - accept mbox (sys_arch_mbox_fetch(&conn->acceptmbox, &accept_ptr, 0); in netconn_accept())
 * - receive mbox (sys_arch_mbox_fetch(&conn->recvmbox, &buf, 0); in netconn_recv_data())
 * - send queue is full (sys_arch_sem_wait(LWIP_API_MSG_SEM(msg), 0); in lwip_netconn_do_write())
 * 
 * The events have to be seen as events signaling the state of these mboxes/semaphores. For non-blocking
 * connections, you need to know in advance whether a call to a netconn function call would block or not,
 * and these events tell you about that.
 * 
 * RCVPLUS events say: Safe to perform a potentially blocking call call once more. 
 * They are counted in sockets - three RCVPLUS events for accept mbox means you are safe
 * to call netconn_accept 3 times without being blocked.
 * Same thing for receive mbox.
 * 
 * RCVMINUS events say: Your call to to a possibly blocking function is "acknowledged".
 * Socket implementation decrements the counter.
 * 
 * For TX, there is no need to count, its merely a flag. SENDPLUS means you may send something.
 * SENDPLUS occurs when enough data was delivered to peer so netconn_send() can be called again.
 * A SENDMINUS event occurs when the next call to a netconn_send() would be blocking.
