 * Default is to use a static 80 byte buffer.

 *
 * "Locale" is the system in C that support language- and

 * symbols, date and time, and multibyte encodings.
 *
 * This setting determines whether the locale interface exist or not.

 * (setlocale, etc). A number of preselected locales can be activated during
 * runtime. The preselected locales and encodings are choosen at linkage. The
 * application will start with the "C" locale choosen. (Single byte encoding is
 * always supported in this mode.)
 *
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, the locale interface (setlocale, etc) does
 * not exist. The C locale is then preset and cannot be changed.
