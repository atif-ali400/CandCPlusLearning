 * When this feature is selected, i.e. set to 1, then FILE descriptors and
 * related functions (e.g. fprintf, fopen) exist. All files, even stdin,
 * stdout, and stderr will then be handled with a file system mechanism that
 * buffers files before accessing the lowlevel I/O interface (__open, __read,

 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, then FILE descriptors and related functions
 * (e.g. fprintf, fopen) does not exist. All functions that normally uses
 * stderr will use stdout instead. Functions that uses stdout and stdin (like

 * __read, __write, etc), i.e. there will not be any buffering.
 *
 * The default is not to have support for FILE descriptors.

 * buffer or uses a one byte buffer allocated in the file descriptor. This
 * setting is only applicable if the FILE descriptors are enabled above.
 *
 * Default is to use a static 80 byte buffer.
 */



/*
 * Support of locale interface
 *
 * "Locale" is the system in C that support language- and
 * contry-specific settings for a number of areas, including currency
 * symbols, date and time, and multibyte encodings.
 *
 * This setting determines whether the locale interface exist or not.
 * When this feature is selected, i.e. set to 1, the locale interface exist
 * (setlocale, etc). A number of preselected locales can be activated during
 * runtime. The preselected locales and encodings are choosen at linkage. The
 * application will start with the "C" locale choosen. (Single byte encoding is
 * always supported in this mode.)
 *
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, the locale interface (setlocale, etc) does
 * not exist. The C locale is then preset and cannot be changed.
 *
 * The default is not to have support for the locale interface with the "C"
 * locale and the single byte encoding.

 * Default is to not have support for multibytes in printf- and scanf-like

 * If selected, i.e. set to 1, strtod supports C99 hexadecimal floating-point

/*

 *
 * This setting controls if 'int' should be used internally in printf, rather
 * than the largest existing integer type. If 'int' is used, any integer or
 * pointer type formatting use 'int' as internal type even though the
 * formatted type is larger. Set to 1 to use 'int' as internal type, otherwise

/*
 * Emit a char a time in printf
 *
 * This setting controls internal output handling. If selected, i.e. set to 1,
 * then printf emits one character at a time, which requires less code but
 * can be slightly slower for some types of output.
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, then printf buffers some outputs.
 *
 * Note that it is recommended to either use full file support (see
 * _DLIB_FILE_DESCRIPTOR) or -- for debug output -- use the linker
 * option "-e__write_buffered=__write" to enable buffered I/O rather
 * than deselecting this feature.

 * not change over the data models used, but the placement of data variables
 * or/and constant variables do.
 *
 * If defined, this symbol is typically defined to the memory attribute that
 * is used by the runtime library. The actual define must use a
 * _Pragma("type_attribute = xxx") construct. In the header files, it is used
 * on all statically linked data objects seen by the application.

/*
 * Include dlmalloc as an alternative heap manager in the product.

 * optionally use the "dlmalloc" package, which provides a more

/*
 * This is the list implementation used by the scheduler.  While it is tailored
 * heavily for the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by
 * application code.
 *
 * list_ts can only store pointers to list_item_ts.  Each ListItem_t contains a
 * numeric value (xItemValue).  Most of the time the lists are sorted in
 * descending item value order.
 *
 * Lists are created already containing one list item.  The value of this
 * item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
 * the end of the list and acts as a marker.  The list member pxHead always
 * points to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list.  This
 * is because the tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of
 * the list.
 *
 * In addition to it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next
 * item in the list (pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer)
 * and a pointer to back to the object that contains it.  These later two
 * pointers are included for efficiency of list manipulation.  There is
 * effectively a two way link between the object containing the list item and
 * the list item itself.

/*
 * The list structure members are modified from within interrupts, and therefore
 * by rights should be declared volatile.  However, they are only modified in a
 * functionally atomic way (within critical sections of with the scheduler
 * suspended) and are either passed by reference into a function or indexed via
 * a volatile variable.  Therefore, in all use cases tested so far, the volatile
 * qualifier can be omitted in order to provide a moderate performance
 * improvement without adversely affecting functional behaviour.  The assembly
 * instructions generated by the IAR, ARM and GCC compilers when the respective
 * compiler's options were set for maximum optimisation has been inspected and
 * deemed to be as intended.  That said, as compiler technology advances, and
 * especially if aggressive cross module optimisation is used (a use case that
 * has not been exercised to any great extend) then it is feasible that the
 * volatile qualifier will be needed for correct optimisation.  It is expected
 * that a compiler removing essential code because, without the volatile
 * qualifier on the list structure members and with aggressive cross module
 * optimisation, the compiler deemed the code unnecessary will result in
 * complete and obvious failure of the scheduler.  If this is ever experienced
 * then the volatile qualifier can be inserted in the relevant places within the
 * list structures by simply defining configLIST_VOLATILE to volatile in
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (as per the example at the bottom of this comment block).
 * If configLIST_VOLATILE is not defined then the preprocessor directives below
 * will simply #define configLIST_VOLATILE away completely.
 *
 * To use volatile list structure members then add the following line to
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (without the quotes):

			1) Stack overflow -

			2) Incorrect interrupt priority assignment, especially on Cortex-M

			   http://www.freertos.org/RTOS-Cortex-M3-M4.html and the definition
			   of configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY on
			   http://www.freertos.org/a00110.html
			3) Calling an API function from within a critical section or when
			   the scheduler is suspended, or calling an API function that does
			   not end in "FromISR" from an interrupt.
			4) Using a queue or semaphore before it has been initialised or
			   before the scheduler has been started (are interrupts firing
			   before vTaskStartScheduler() has been called?).
