/*
 * File handling
 *
 * Determines whether FILE descriptors and related functions exists or not.
 * When this feature is selected, i.e. set to 1, then FILE descriptors and
 * related functions (e.g. fprintf, fopen) exist. All files, even stdin,
 * stdout, and stderr will then be handled with a file system mechanism that
 * buffers files before accessing the lowlevel I/O interface (__open, __read,
 * __write, etc).
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, then FILE descriptors and related functions
 * (e.g. fprintf, fopen) does not exist. All functions that normally uses
 * stderr will use stdout instead. Functions that uses stdout and stdin (like
 * printf and scanf) will access the lowlevel I/O interface directly (__open,
 * __read, __write, etc), i.e. there will not be any buffering.
 *
 * The default is not to have support for FILE descriptors.
 */



/*
 * Use static buffers for stdout
 *
 * This setting controls whether the stream stdout uses a static 80 bytes
 * buffer or uses a one byte buffer allocated in the file descriptor. This
 * setting is only applicable if the FILE descriptors are enabled above.
 *
 * Default is to use a static 80 byte buffer.
 */



/*
 * Support of locale interface
 *
 * "Locale" is the system in C that support language- and
 * contry-specific settings for a number of areas, including currency
 * symbols, date and time, and multibyte encodings.
 *
 * This setting determines whether the locale interface exist or not.
 * When this feature is selected, i.e. set to 1, the locale interface exist
 * (setlocale, etc). A number of preselected locales can be activated during
 * runtime. The preselected locales and encodings are choosen at linkage. The
 * application will start with the "C" locale choosen. (Single byte encoding is
 * always supported in this mode.)
 *
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, the locale interface (setlocale, etc) does
 * not exist. The C locale is then preset and cannot be changed.
 *
 * The default is not to have support for the locale interface with the "C"
 * locale and the single byte encoding.
 */


/*
 * Define what memory to place the locale table segment (.iar.locale_table)
 * in.
 */

/*
 * Wide character and multi byte character support in library.

/*
 * Support of multibytes in printf- and scanf-like functions
 *
 * This is the default value for _DLIB_PRINTF_MULTIBYTE and
 * _DLIB_SCANF_MULTIBYTE. See them for a description.
 *
 * Default is to not have support for multibytes in printf- and scanf-like
 * functions.
 */


/*
 * Hexadecimal floating-point numbers in strtod
 *
 * If selected, i.e. set to 1, strtod supports C99 hexadecimal floating-point
 * numbers. This also enables hexadecimal floating-points in internal functions
 * used for converting strings and wide strings to float, double, and long
 * double.
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, C99 hexadecimal floating-point numbers
 * aren't supported.
 *
 * Default is not to support hexadecimal floating-point numbers.

/*
 * Printf configuration symbols.
 *
 * All the configuration symbols described further on controls the behaviour
 * of printf, sprintf, and the other printf variants.
 *
 * The library proves four formatters for printf: 'tiny', 'small',
 * 'large', and 'default'.  The setup in this file controls all except
 * 'tiny'.  Note that both small' and 'large' explicitly removes
 * some features.
 */

/*
 * Handle multibytes in printf
 *
 * This setting controls whether multibytes and wchar_ts are supported in
 * printf. Set to 1 to support them, otherwise set to 0.
 *
 * See _DLIB_FORMATTED_MULTIBYTE for the default setting.
 */

/*
 * Support of formatting anything larger than int in printf
 *
 * This setting controls if 'int' should be used internally in printf, rather
 * than the largest existing integer type. If 'int' is used, any integer or
 * pointer type formatting use 'int' as internal type even though the
 * formatted type is larger. Set to 1 to use 'int' as internal type, otherwise
 * set to 0.
 *
 * See also next configuration.
 *
 * Default is to internally use largest existing internally type.
 */

/*
 * Support of formatting anything larger than long in printf
 *
 * This setting controls if 'long' should be used internally in printf, rather
 * than the largest existing integer type. If 'long' is used, any integer or
 * pointer type formatting use 'long' as internal type even though the
 * formatted type is larger. Set to 1 to use 'long' as internal type,
 * otherwise set to 0.
 *
 * See also previous configuration.
 *
 * Default is to internally use largest existing internally type.
 */


/*
 * Emit a char a time in printf
 *
 * This setting controls internal output handling. If selected, i.e. set to 1,
 * then printf emits one character at a time, which requires less code but
 * can be slightly slower for some types of output.
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, then printf buffers some outputs.
 *
 * Note that it is recommended to either use full file support (see
 * _DLIB_FILE_DESCRIPTOR) or -- for debug output -- use the linker
 * option "-e__write_buffered=__write" to enable buffered I/O rather
 * than deselecting this feature.
 */


/*
 * Scanf configuration symbols.
 *
 * All the configuration symbols described here controls the
 * behaviour of scanf, sscanf, and the other scanf variants.
 *
 * The library proves three formatters for scanf: 'small', 'large',
 * and 'default'.  The setup in this file controls all, however both
 * 'small' and 'large' explicitly removes some features.
 */

/*
 * Handle multibytes in scanf
 *
 * This setting controls whether multibytes and wchar_t:s are supported in
 * scanf. Set to 1 to support them, otherwise set to 0.
 *
 * See _DLIB_FORMATTED_MULTIBYTE for the default.

/*
 * Handle multibytes in asctime and strftime.
 *
 * This setting controls whether multibytes and wchar_ts are
 * supported.Set to 1 to support them, otherwise set to 0.
 *
 * See _DLIB_FORMATTED_MULTIBYTE for the default setting.
 */

/*
 * Implement "qsort" using a bubble sort algorithm.
 *
 * Bubble sort is less efficient than quick sort but requires less RAM
 * and ROM resources.
 */



/*
 * Set Buffert size used in qsort
 */



/*
 * Use a simple rand implementation to reduce memory footprint.
 *
 * The default "rand" function uses an array of 32 32-bit integers of memory to
 * store the current state.
 *
 * The simple "rand" function uses only a single 32-bit integer. However, the
 * quality of the generated psuedo-random numbers are not as good as
 * the default implementation.
 */



/*
 * Set attributes for the function used by the C-SPY debug interface to stop at.
 */


/*
 * Used by products where one runtime library can be used by applications
 * with different data models, in order to reduce the total number of
 * libraries required. Typically, this is used when the pointer types does
 * not change over the data models used, but the placement of data variables
 * or/and constant variables do.
 *
 * If defined, this symbol is typically defined to the memory attribute that
 * is used by the runtime library. The actual define must use a
 * _Pragma("type_attribute = xxx") construct. In the header files, it is used
 * on all statically linked data objects seen by the application.
 */



/*
 * Turn on support for the Target-specific ABI. The ABI is based on the
 * ARM AEABI. A target, except ARM, may deviate from it.
 */


  /* Possible AEABI deviations */


  /*
   * The "difunc" table contains information about C++ objects that
   * should be dynamically initialized, where each entry in the table
   * represents an initialization function that should be called. When
   * the symbol _DLIB_AEABI_DIFUNC_CONTAINS_OFFSETS is true, each
   * entry in the table is encoded as an offset from the entry
   * location. When false, the entries contain the actual addresses to
   * call.
   */

/*
 * Only use IA64 functions
 *
 * Remove the C++ __aeabi functions when using the IA64 interface. Used in
 * ARM AARCH64 mode.
 *
 */

/*
 * Turn on usage of a pragma to tell the linker the number of elements used
 * in a setjmp jmp_buf.
 */



/*
 * If true, the product supplies a "DLib_Product_string.h" file that
 * is included from "string.h".
 */


/*
 * Determine whether the math fma routines are fast or not.
 */


/*
 * Favor speed versus some size enlargements in floating point functions.
 */


/*
 * Include dlmalloc as an alternative heap manager in the product.
 *
 * Typically, an application will use a "malloc" heap manager that is
 * relatively small but not that efficient. An application can
 * optionally use the "dlmalloc" package, which provides a more
 * effective "malloc" heap manager, if it is included in the product
 * and supported by the settings.
 *
 * See the product documentation on how to use it, and whether or not
 * it is included in the product.
 */

  /* size_t/ptrdiff_t must be a 4 bytes unsigned integer. */


/*
 * Make sure certain C++ functions use the soft floating point variant.
 */



/*
 * Allow the 64-bit time_t interface?
 *
 * Default is yes if long long is 64 bits.
 */



/*
 * Is time_t 64 or 32 bits?
 *
 * Default is 32 bits.
 */



/*
 * Do we include math functions that demands lots of constant bytes?
 * (like erf, erfc, expm1, fma, lgamma, tgamma, and *_accurate)
 *
 */



/*
 * Support of weak.
 *
 * __weak must be supported. Support of weak means that the call to
 * a weak declared function that isn't part of the application will be
 * executed as a nop instruction.
 *
 */



/*
 * Deleted options

/*
 * This is the list implementation used by the scheduler.  While it is tailored
 * heavily for the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by
 * application code.
 *
 * list_ts can only store pointers to list_item_ts.  Each ListItem_t contains a
 * numeric value (xItemValue).  Most of the time the lists are sorted in
 * descending item value order.
 *
 * Lists are created already containing one list item.  The value of this
 * item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
 * the end of the list and acts as a marker.  The list member pxHead always
 * points to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list.  This
 * is because the tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of
 * the list.
 *
 * In addition to it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next
 * item in the list (pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer)
 * and a pointer to back to the object that contains it.  These later two
 * pointers are included for efficiency of list manipulation.  There is
 * effectively a two way link between the object containing the list item and
 * the list item itself.

/*
 * The list structure members are modified from within interrupts, and therefore
 * by rights should be declared volatile.  However, they are only modified in a
 * functionally atomic way (within critical sections of with the scheduler
 * suspended) and are either passed by reference into a function or indexed via
 * a volatile variable.  Therefore, in all use cases tested so far, the volatile
 * qualifier can be omitted in order to provide a moderate performance
 * improvement without adversely affecting functional behaviour.  The assembly
 * instructions generated by the IAR, ARM and GCC compilers when the respective
 * compiler's options were set for maximum optimisation has been inspected and
 * deemed to be as intended.  That said, as compiler technology advances, and
 * especially if aggressive cross module optimisation is used (a use case that
 * has not been exercised to any great extend) then it is feasible that the
 * volatile qualifier will be needed for correct optimisation.  It is expected
 * that a compiler removing essential code because, without the volatile
 * qualifier on the list structure members and with aggressive cross module
 * optimisation, the compiler deemed the code unnecessary will result in
 * complete and obvious failure of the scheduler.  If this is ever experienced
 * then the volatile qualifier can be inserted in the relevant places within the
 * list structures by simply defining configLIST_VOLATILE to volatile in
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (as per the example at the bottom of this comment block).
 * If configLIST_VOLATILE is not defined then the preprocessor directives below
 * will simply #define configLIST_VOLATILE away completely.
 *
 * To use volatile list structure members then add the following line to
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (without the quotes):

 * Create a new task and add it to the list of tasks that are ready to run.
 *
 * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, tasks use two blocks of
 * memory.  The first block is used to hold the task's data structures.  The
 * second block is used by the task as its stack.  If a task is created using
 * xTaskCreate() then both blocks of memory are automatically dynamically
 * allocated inside the xTaskCreate() function.  (see
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a task is created using
 * xTaskCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the required
 * memory.  xTaskCreateStatic() therefore allows a task to be created without
 * using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * See xTaskCreateStatic() for a version that does not use any dynamic memory
 * allocation.
 *
 * xTaskCreate() can only be used to create a task that has unrestricted
 * access to the entire microcontroller memory map.  Systems that include MPU
 * support can alternatively create an MPU constrained task using
 * xTaskCreateRestricted().
 *
 * @param pvTaskCode Pointer to the task entry function.  Tasks
 * must be implemented to never return (i.e. continuous loop).
 *
 * @param pcName A descriptive name for the task.  This is mainly used to
 * facilitate debugging.  Max length defined by configMAX_TASK_NAME_LEN - default
 * is 16.
 *
 * @param usStackDepth The size of the task stack specified as the number of
 * variables the stack can hold - not the number of bytes.  For example, if
 * the stack is 16 bits wide and usStackDepth is defined as 100, 200 bytes
 * will be allocated for stack storage.
 *
 * @param pvParameters Pointer that will be used as the parameter for the task
 * being created.
 *
 * @param uxPriority The priority at which the task should run.  Systems that
 * include MPU support can optionally create tasks in a privileged (system)
 * mode by setting bit portPRIVILEGE_BIT of the priority parameter.  For
 * example, to create a privileged task at priority 2 the uxPriority parameter
 * should be set to ( 2 | portPRIVILEGE_BIT ).

 * Create a new task and add it to the list of tasks that are ready to run.
 *
 * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, tasks use two blocks of
 * memory.  The first block is used to hold the task's data structures.  The
 * second block is used by the task as its stack.  If a task is created using
 * xTaskCreate() then both blocks of memory are automatically dynamically
 * allocated inside the xTaskCreate() function.  (see
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a task is created using
 * xTaskCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the required
 * memory.  xTaskCreateStatic() therefore allows a task to be created without
 * using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * @param pvTaskCode Pointer to the task entry function.  Tasks
 * must be implemented to never return (i.e. continuous loop).
 *
 * @param pcName A descriptive name for the task.  This is mainly used to
 * facilitate debugging.  The maximum length of the string is defined by
 * configMAX_TASK_NAME_LEN in FreeRTOSConfig.h.
 *
 * @param ulStackDepth The size of the task stack specified as the number of
 * variables the stack can hold - not the number of bytes.  For example, if
 * the stack is 32-bits wide and ulStackDepth is defined as 100 then 400 bytes
 * will be allocated for stack storage.
 *
 * @param pvParameters Pointer that will be used as the parameter for the task
 * being created.
 *
 * @param uxPriority The priority at which the task will run.
 *
 * @param pxStackBuffer Must point to a StackType_t array that has at least
 * ulStackDepth indexes - the array will then be used as the task's stack,
 * removing the need for the stack to be allocated dynamically.
 *
 * @param pxTaskBuffer Must point to a variable of type StaticTask_t, which will
 * then be used to hold the task's data structures, removing the need for the
 * memory to be allocated dynamically.
 *
 * @return If neither pxStackBuffer or pxTaskBuffer are NULL, then the task will

 *
 *
 * vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock relative to

 * period of 100 ticks will cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after
 * vTaskDelay() is called.  vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good method
 * of controlling the frequency of a periodic task as the path taken through the

 * at which vTaskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the task
 * next executes.  See vTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative API function designed
 * to facilitate fixed frequency execution.  It does this by specifying an
 * absolute time (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task should
 * unblock.

 * execution frequency as the time between a task starting to execute and that task
 * calling vTaskDelay () may not be fixed [the task may take a different path though the
 * code between calls, or may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
 * each time it executes].
 *
 * Whereas vTaskDelay () specifies a wake time relative to the time at which the function
 * is called, vTaskDelayUntil () specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
 * unblock.
 *
 * The constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * @param pxPreviousWakeTime Pointer to a variable that holds the time at which the

 * Events can be sent to a task using an intermediary object.  Examples of such

 *
 * A notification sent to a task can optionally perform an action, such as
 * update, overwrite or increment the task's notification value.  In that way
 * task notifications can be used to send data to a task, or be used as light
 * weight and fast binary or counting semaphores.
 *
 * A notification sent to a task will remain pending until it is cleared by the
 * task calling xTaskNotifyWait() or ulTaskNotifyTake().  If the task was
 * already in the Blocked state to wait for a notification when the notification
 * arrives then the task will automatically be removed from the Blocked state
 * (unblocked) and the notification cleared.
 *
 * A task can use xTaskNotifyWait() to [optionally] block to wait for a
 * notification to be pending, or ulTaskNotifyTake() to [optionally] block
 * to wait for its notification value to have a non-zero value.  The task does
 * not consume any CPU time while it is in the Blocked state.
 *
 * See http://www.FreeRTOS.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html for details.

 * @param ulBitsToClearOnEntry Bits that are set in ulBitsToClearOnEntry value
 * will be cleared in the calling task's notification value before the task
 * checks to see if any notifications are pending, and optionally blocks if no
 * notifications are pending.  Setting ulBitsToClearOnEntry to ULONG_MAX (if
 * limits.h is included) or 0xffffffffUL (if limits.h is not included) will have
 * the effect of resetting the task's notification value to 0.  Setting
 * ulBitsToClearOnEntry to 0 will leave the task's notification value unchanged.
 *
 * @param ulBitsToClearOnExit If a notification is pending or received before
 * the calling task exits the xTaskNotifyWait() function then the task's
 * notification value (see the xTaskNotify() API function) is passed out using
 * the pulNotificationValue parameter.  Then any bits that are set in
 * ulBitsToClearOnExit will be cleared in the task's notification value (note
 * *pulNotificationValue is set before any bits are cleared).  Setting
 * ulBitsToClearOnExit to ULONG_MAX (if limits.h is included) or 0xffffffffUL
 * (if limits.h is not included) will have the effect of resetting the task's
 * notification value to 0 before the function exits.  Setting
 * ulBitsToClearOnExit to 0 will leave the task's notification value unchanged
 * when the function exits (in which case the value passed out in
 * pulNotificationValue will match the task's notification value).
 *
 * @param pulNotificationValue Used to pass the task's notification value out
 * of the function.  Note the value passed out will not be effected by the
 * clearing of any bits caused by ulBitsToClearOnExit being non-zero.
 *
 * @param xTicksToWait The maximum amount of time that the task should wait in
 * the Blocked state for a notification to be received, should a notification
 * not already be pending when xTaskNotifyWait() was called.  The task
 * will not consume any processing time while it is in the Blocked state.  This
 * is specified in kernel ticks, the macro pdMS_TO_TICSK( value_in_ms ) can be
 * used to convert a time specified in milliseconds to a time specified in

 *
 * Creates a new software timer instance, and returns a handle by which the
 * created software timer can be referenced.
 *
 * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, software timers use a block
 * of memory, in which the timer data structure is stored.  If a software timer
 * is created using xTimerCreate() then the required memory is automatically
 * dynamically allocated inside the xTimerCreate() function.  (see
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a software timer is created using
 * xTimerCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the memory that
 * will get used by the software timer.  xTimerCreateStatic() therefore allows a
 * software timer to be created without using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * Timers are created in the dormant state.  The xTimerStart(), xTimerReset(),
 * xTimerStartFromISR(), xTimerResetFromISR(), xTimerChangePeriod() and
 * xTimerChangePeriodFromISR() API functions can all be used to transition a
 * timer into the active state.
 *
 * @param pcTimerName A text name that is assigned to the timer.  This is done
 * purely to assist debugging.  The kernel itself only ever references a timer
 * by its handle, and never by its name.
 *
 * @param xTimerPeriodInTicks The timer period.  The time is defined in tick
 * periods so the constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to convert a time that
 * has been specified in milliseconds.  For example, if the timer must expire
 * after 100 ticks, then xTimerPeriodInTicks should be set to 100.
 * Alternatively, if the timer must expire after 500ms, then xPeriod can be set
 * to ( 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS ) provided configTICK_RATE_HZ is less than or
 * equal to 1000.
 *
 * @param uxAutoReload If uxAutoReload is set to pdTRUE then the timer will
 * expire repeatedly with a frequency set by the xTimerPeriodInTicks parameter.
 * If uxAutoReload is set to pdFALSE then the timer will be a one-shot timer and
 * enter the dormant state after it expires.
 *
 * @param pvTimerID An identifier that is assigned to the timer being created.
 * Typically this would be used in the timer callback function to identify which
 * timer expired when the same callback function is assigned to more than one
 * timer.
 *
 * @param pxCallbackFunction The function to call when the timer expires.
 * Callback functions must have the prototype defined by TimerCallbackFunction_t,
 * which is	"void vCallbackFunction( TimerHandle_t xTimer );".
 *
 * @return If the timer is successfully created then a handle to the newly
 * created timer is returned.  If the timer cannot be created (because either
 * there is insufficient FreeRTOS heap remaining to allocate the timer
 * structures, or the timer period was set to 0) then NULL is returned.

 *
 * Creates a new software timer instance, and returns a handle by which the
 * created software timer can be referenced.
 *
 * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, software timers use a block
 * of memory, in which the timer data structure is stored.  If a software timer
 * is created using xTimerCreate() then the required memory is automatically
 * dynamically allocated inside the xTimerCreate() function.  (see
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a software timer is created using
 * xTimerCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the memory that
 * will get used by the software timer.  xTimerCreateStatic() therefore allows a
 * software timer to be created without using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * Timers are created in the dormant state.  The xTimerStart(), xTimerReset(),
 * xTimerStartFromISR(), xTimerResetFromISR(), xTimerChangePeriod() and
 * xTimerChangePeriodFromISR() API functions can all be used to transition a
 * timer into the active state.
 *
 * @param pcTimerName A text name that is assigned to the timer.  This is done
 * purely to assist debugging.  The kernel itself only ever references a timer
 * by its handle, and never by its name.
 *
 * @param xTimerPeriodInTicks The timer period.  The time is defined in tick
 * periods so the constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to convert a time that
 * has been specified in milliseconds.  For example, if the timer must expire
 * after 100 ticks, then xTimerPeriodInTicks should be set to 100.
 * Alternatively, if the timer must expire after 500ms, then xPeriod can be set
 * to ( 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS ) provided configTICK_RATE_HZ is less than or
 * equal to 1000.
 *
 * @param uxAutoReload If uxAutoReload is set to pdTRUE then the timer will
 * expire repeatedly with a frequency set by the xTimerPeriodInTicks parameter.
 * If uxAutoReload is set to pdFALSE then the timer will be a one-shot timer and
 * enter the dormant state after it expires.
 *
 * @param pvTimerID An identifier that is assigned to the timer being created.
 * Typically this would be used in the timer callback function to identify which
 * timer expired when the same callback function is assigned to more than one
 * timer.
 *
 * @param pxCallbackFunction The function to call when the timer expires.
 * Callback functions must have the prototype defined by TimerCallbackFunction_t,
 * which is "void vCallbackFunction( TimerHandle_t xTimer );".
 *
 * @param pxTimerBuffer Must point to a variable of type StaticTimer_t, which
 * will be then be used to hold the software timer's data structures, removing
 * the need for the memory to be allocated dynamically.
 *
 * @return If the timer is created then a handle to the created timer is
 * returned.  If pxTimerBuffer was NULL then NULL is returned.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @verbatim
 *
 * // The buffer used to hold the software timer's data structure.
 * static StaticTimer_t xTimerBuffer;
 *
 * // A variable that will be incremented by the software timer's callback
 * // function.
 * UBaseType_t uxVariableToIncrement = 0;
 *
 * // A software timer callback function that increments a variable passed to
 * // it when the software timer was created.  After the 5th increment the
 * // callback function stops the software timer.

 *     puxVariableToIncrement = ( UBaseType_t * ) pvTimerGetTimerID( xExpiredTimer );
 *

 *     ( *puxVariableToIncrement )++;
 *
 *     // If this callback has executed the required number of times, stop the
 *     // timer.

 *
 *
 * Used from application interrupt service routines to defer the execution of a
 * function to the RTOS daemon task (the timer service task, hence this function
 * is implemented in timers.c and is prefixed with 'Timer').
 *
 * Ideally an interrupt service routine (ISR) is kept as short as possible, but
 * sometimes an ISR either has a lot of processing to do, or needs to perform
 * processing that is not deterministic.  In these cases
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR() can be used to defer processing of a function
 * to the RTOS daemon task.
 *
 * A mechanism is provided that allows the interrupt to return directly to the
 * task that will subsequently execute the pended callback function.  This
 * allows the callback function to execute contiguously in time with the
 * interrupt - just as if the callback had executed in the interrupt itself.
 *
 * @param xFunctionToPend The function to execute from the timer service/
 * daemon task.  The function must conform to the PendedFunction_t
 * prototype.
 *
 * @param pvParameter1 The value of the callback function's first parameter.
 * The parameter has a void * type to allow it to be used to pass any type.
 * For example, unsigned longs can be cast to a void *, or the void * can be
 * used to point to a structure.
 *
 * @param ulParameter2 The value of the callback function's second parameter.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken As mentioned above, calling this function
 * will result in a message being sent to the timer daemon task.  If the
 * priority of the timer daemon task (which is set using
 * configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY in FreeRTOSConfig.h) is higher than the priority of
 * the currently running task (the task the interrupt interrupted) then
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken will be set to pdTRUE within
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR(), indicating that a context switch should be
 * requested before the interrupt exits.  For that reason
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken must be initialised to pdFALSE.  See the
 * example code below.
 *
 * @return pdPASS is returned if the message was successfully sent to the
 * timer daemon task, otherwise pdFALSE is returned.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @verbatim
 *
 *	// The callback function that will execute in the context of the daemon task.
 *  // Note callback functions must all use this same prototype.
 *  void vProcessInterface( void *pvParameter1, uint32_t ulParameter2 )

 *		BaseType_t xInterfaceToService;
 *
 *		// The interface that requires servicing is passed in the second
 *      // parameter.  The first parameter is not used in this case.

 *		// ...Perform the processing here...
 *	}

 *	// An ISR that receives data packets from multiple interfaces
 *  void vAnISR( void )
 *	{

 *		// not used in this case.
 *		xHigherPriorityTaskWoken = pdFALSE;
 *		xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR( vProcessInterface, NULL, ( uint32_t ) xInterfaceToService, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
 *

 * Queue sets provide a mechanism to allow a task to block (pend) on a read
 * operation from multiple queues or semaphores simultaneously.
 *
 * See FreeRTOS/Source/Demo/Common/Minimal/QueueSet.c for an example using this
 * function.
 *
 * A queue set must be explicitly created using a call to xQueueCreateSet()
 * before it can be used.  Once created, standard FreeRTOS queues and semaphores
 * can be added to the set using calls to xQueueAddToSet().
 * xQueueSelectFromSet() is then used to determine which, if any, of the queues
 * or semaphores contained in the set is in a state where a queue read or
 * semaphore take operation would be successful.
 *
 * Note 1:  See the documentation on http://wwwFreeRTOS.org/RTOS-queue-sets.html
 * for reasons why queue sets are very rarely needed in practice as there are
 * simpler methods of blocking on multiple objects.
 *
 * Note 2:  Blocking on a queue set that contains a mutex will not cause the
 * mutex holder to inherit the priority of the blocked task.
 *
 * Note 3:  An additional 4 bytes of RAM is required for each space in a every
 * queue added to a queue set.  Therefore counting semaphores that have a high
 * maximum count value should not be added to a queue set.
 *
 * Note 4:  A receive (in the case of a queue) or take (in the case of a
 * semaphore) operation must not be performed on a member of a queue set unless
 * a call to xQueueSelectFromSet() has first returned a handle to that set member.
 *
 * @param uxEventQueueLength Queue sets store events that occur on
 * the queues and semaphores contained in the set.  uxEventQueueLength specifies
 * the maximum number of events that can be queued at once.  To be absolutely
 * certain that events are not lost uxEventQueueLength should be set to the
 * total sum of the length of the queues added to the set, where binary
 * semaphores and mutexes have a length of 1, and counting semaphores have a
 * length set by their maximum count value.  Examples:
 *  + If a queue set is to hold a queue of length 5, another queue of length 12,
 *    and a binary semaphore, then uxEventQueueLength should be set to
 *    (5 + 12 + 1), or 18.
 *  + If a queue set is to hold three binary semaphores then uxEventQueueLength
 *    should be set to (1 + 1 + 1 ), or 3.
 *  + If a queue set is to hold a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of
 *    5, and a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of 3, then
 *    uxEventQueueLength should be set to (5 + 3), or 8.

 * queue set is returned.  Otherwise NULL is returned.

/**
 * An event group is a collection of bits to which an application can assign a
 * meaning.  For example, an application may create an event group to convey
 * the status of various CAN bus related events in which bit 0 might mean "A CAN
 * message has been received and is ready for processing", bit 1 might mean "The
 * application has queued a message that is ready for sending onto the CAN
 * network", and bit 2 might mean "It is time to send a SYNC message onto the
 * CAN network" etc.  A task can then test the bit values to see which events
 * are active, and optionally enter the Blocked state to wait for a specified
 * bit or a group of specified bits to be active.  To continue the CAN bus
 * example, a CAN controlling task can enter the Blocked state (and therefore
 * not consume any processing time) until either bit 0, bit 1 or bit 2 are
 * active, at which time the bit that was actually active would inform the task
 * which action it had to take (process a received message, send a message, or
 * send a SYNC).
 *
 * The event groups implementation contains intelligence to avoid race
 * conditions that would otherwise occur were an application to use a simple
 * variable for the same purpose.  This is particularly important with respect
 * to when a bit within an event group is to be cleared, and when bits have to
 * be set and then tested atomically - as is the case where event groups are
 * used to create a synchronisation point between multiple tasks (a
 * 'rendezvous').

 * The function will return before its block time expires if the bits specified
 * by the uxBitsToWait parameter are set, or become set within that time.  In
 * this case all the bits specified by uxBitsToWait will be automatically
 * cleared before the function returns.
 *
 * @param xEventGroup The event group in which the bits are being tested.  The
 * event group must have previously been created using a call to
 * xEventGroupCreate().
 *
 * @param uxBitsToSet The bits to set in the event group before determining
 * if, and possibly waiting for, all the bits specified by the uxBitsToWait
 * parameter are set.
 *
 * @param uxBitsToWaitFor A bitwise value that indicates the bit or bits to test
 * inside the event group.  For example, to wait for bit 0 and bit 2 set
 * uxBitsToWaitFor to 0x05.  To wait for bits 0 and bit 1 and bit 2 set
 * uxBitsToWaitFor to 0x07.  Etc.
 *
 * @param xTicksToWait The maximum amount of time (specified in 'ticks') to wait
 * for all of the bits specified by uxBitsToWaitFor to become set.
 *
 * @return The value of the event group at the time either the bits being waited
 * for became set, or the block time expired.  Test the return value to know
 * which bits were set.  If xEventGroupSync() returned because its timeout
 * expired then not all the bits being waited for will be set.  If
 * xEventGroupSync() returned because all the bits it was waiting for were
 * set then the returned value is the event group value before any bits were
 * automatically cleared.

/**
\page cmsis_os_h Header File Template: cmsis_os.h

The file \b cmsis_os.h is a template header file for a CMSIS-RTOS compliant Real-Time Operating System (RTOS).
Each RTOS that is compliant with CMSIS-RTOS shall provide a specific \b cmsis_os.h header file that represents
its implementation.

The file cmsis_os.h contains:
 - CMSIS-RTOS API function definitions
 - struct definitions for parameters and return types
 - status and priority values used by CMSIS-RTOS API functions
 - macros for defining threads and other kernel objects


<b>Name conventions and header file modifications</b>

All definitions are prefixed with \b os to give an unique name space for CMSIS-RTOS functions.
Definitions that are prefixed \b os_ are not used in the application code but local to this header file.
All definitions and functions that belong to a module are grouped and have a common prefix, i.e. \b osThread.

Definitions that are marked with <b>CAN BE CHANGED</b> can be adapted towards the needs of the actual CMSIS-RTOS implementation.
These definitions can be specific to the underlying RTOS kernel.

Definitions that are marked with <b>MUST REMAIN UNCHANGED</b> cannot be altered. Otherwise the CMSIS-RTOS implementation is no longer
compliant to the standard. Note that some functions are optional and need not to be provided by every CMSIS-RTOS implementation.


<b>Function calls from interrupt service routines</b>

The following CMSIS-RTOS functions can be called from threads and interrupt service routines (ISR):
  - \ref osSignalSet
  - \ref osSemaphoreRelease
  - \ref osPoolAlloc, \ref osPoolCAlloc, \ref osPoolFree
  - \ref osMessagePut, \ref osMessageGet
  - \ref osMailAlloc, \ref osMailCAlloc, \ref osMailGet, \ref osMailPut, \ref osMailFree

Functions that cannot be called from an ISR are verifying the interrupt status and return in case that they are called
from an ISR context the status code \b osErrorISR. In some implementations this condition might be caught using the HARD FAULT vector.

Some CMSIS-RTOS implementations support CMSIS-RTOS function calls from multiple ISR at the same time.
If this is impossible, the CMSIS-RTOS rejects calls by nested ISR functions with the status code \b osErrorISRRecursive.


<b>Define and reference object definitions</b>

With <b>\#define osObjectsExternal</b> objects are defined as external symbols. This allows to create a consistent header file
that is used throughout a project as shown below:

<i>Header File</i>
\code
#include <cmsis_os.h>                                         // CMSIS RTOS header file

// Thread definition
extern void thread_sample (void const *argument);             // function prototype
osThreadDef (thread_sample, osPriorityBelowNormal, 1, 100);

// Pool definition
osPoolDef(MyPool, 10, long);
\endcode


This header file defines all objects when included in a C/C++ source file. When <b>\#define osObjectsExternal</b> is
present before the header file, the objects are defined as external symbols. A single consistent header file can therefore be
used throughout the whole project.

<i>Example</i>
\code
#include "osObjects.h"     // Definition of the CMSIS-RTOS objects
\endcode

\code
#define osObjectExternal   // Objects will be defined as external symbols
#include "osObjects.h"     // Reference to the CMSIS-RTOS objects
\endcode
