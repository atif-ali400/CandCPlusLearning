 * When this feature is selected, i.e. set to 1, then FILE descriptors and

 * stdout, and stderr will then be handled with a file system mechanism that
 * buffers files before accessing the lowlevel I/O interface (__open, __read,

 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, then FILE descriptors and related functions
 * (e.g. fprintf, fopen) does not exist. All functions that normally uses
 * stderr will use stdout instead. Functions that uses stdout and stdin (like
 * printf and scanf) will access the lowlevel I/O interface directly (__open,
 * __read, __write, etc), i.e. there will not be any buffering.
 *
 * The default is not to have support for FILE descriptors.

 * buffer or uses a one byte buffer allocated in the file descriptor. This
 * setting is only applicable if the FILE descriptors are enabled above.
 *
 * Default is to use a static 80 byte buffer.
 */



/*
 * Support of locale interface
 *
 * "Locale" is the system in C that support language- and
 * contry-specific settings for a number of areas, including currency
 * symbols, date and time, and multibyte encodings.
 *
 * This setting determines whether the locale interface exist or not.
 * When this feature is selected, i.e. set to 1, the locale interface exist
 * (setlocale, etc). A number of preselected locales can be activated during
 * runtime. The preselected locales and encodings are choosen at linkage. The
 * application will start with the "C" locale choosen. (Single byte encoding is
 * always supported in this mode.)
 *
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, the locale interface (setlocale, etc) does
 * not exist. The C locale is then preset and cannot be changed.
 *
 * The default is not to have support for the locale interface with the "C"

 *
 * This setting controls if 'int' should be used internally in printf, rather
 * than the largest existing integer type. If 'int' is used, any integer or
 * pointer type formatting use 'int' as internal type even though the

/*
 * Emit a char a time in printf
 *
 * This setting controls internal output handling. If selected, i.e. set to 1,
 * then printf emits one character at a time, which requires less code but
 * can be slightly slower for some types of output.
 *
 * If not selected, i.e. set to 0, then printf buffers some outputs.
 *
 * Note that it is recommended to either use full file support (see

 * option "-e__write_buffered=__write" to enable buffered I/O rather
 * than deselecting this feature.

 *
 * If defined, this symbol is typically defined to the memory attribute that

/*
 * This is the list implementation used by the scheduler.  While it is tailored
 * heavily for the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by
 * application code.
 *
 * list_ts can only store pointers to list_item_ts.  Each ListItem_t contains a
 * numeric value (xItemValue).  Most of the time the lists are sorted in
 * descending item value order.
 *
 * Lists are created already containing one list item.  The value of this
 * item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
 * the end of the list and acts as a marker.  The list member pxHead always
 * points to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list.  This
 * is because the tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of
 * the list.
 *
 * In addition to it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next
 * item in the list (pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer)
 * and a pointer to back to the object that contains it.  These later two
 * pointers are included for efficiency of list manipulation.  There is
 * effectively a two way link between the object containing the list item and
 * the list item itself.

/*
 * The list structure members are modified from within interrupts, and therefore
 * by rights should be declared volatile.  However, they are only modified in a
 * functionally atomic way (within critical sections of with the scheduler
 * suspended) and are either passed by reference into a function or indexed via
 * a volatile variable.  Therefore, in all use cases tested so far, the volatile
 * qualifier can be omitted in order to provide a moderate performance
 * improvement without adversely affecting functional behaviour.  The assembly
 * instructions generated by the IAR, ARM and GCC compilers when the respective
 * compiler's options were set for maximum optimisation has been inspected and
 * deemed to be as intended.  That said, as compiler technology advances, and
 * especially if aggressive cross module optimisation is used (a use case that
 * has not been exercised to any great extend) then it is feasible that the
 * volatile qualifier will be needed for correct optimisation.  It is expected
 * that a compiler removing essential code because, without the volatile
 * qualifier on the list structure members and with aggressive cross module
 * optimisation, the compiler deemed the code unnecessary will result in
 * complete and obvious failure of the scheduler.  If this is ever experienced
 * then the volatile qualifier can be inserted in the relevant places within the
 * list structures by simply defining configLIST_VOLATILE to volatile in
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (as per the example at the bottom of this comment block).
 * If configLIST_VOLATILE is not defined then the preprocessor directives below
 * will simply #define configLIST_VOLATILE away completely.
 *
 * To use volatile list structure members then add the following line to
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (without the quotes):

 * 								TimerCallbackFunction_t pxCallbackFunction );
 *
 * Creates a new software timer instance, and returns a handle by which the
 * created software timer can be referenced.
 *
 * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, software timers use a block
 * of memory, in which the timer data structure is stored.  If a software timer
 * is created using xTimerCreate() then the required memory is automatically
 * dynamically allocated inside the xTimerCreate() function.  (see
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a software timer is created using
 * xTimerCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the memory that
 * will get used by the software timer.  xTimerCreateStatic() therefore allows a
 * software timer to be created without using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * Timers are created in the dormant state.  The xTimerStart(), xTimerReset(),
 * xTimerStartFromISR(), xTimerResetFromISR(), xTimerChangePeriod() and
 * xTimerChangePeriodFromISR() API functions can all be used to transition a
 * timer into the active state.
 *
 * @param pcTimerName A text name that is assigned to the timer.  This is done
 * purely to assist debugging.  The kernel itself only ever references a timer
 * by its handle, and never by its name.
 *
 * @param xTimerPeriodInTicks The timer period.  The time is defined in tick
 * periods so the constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to convert a time that
 * has been specified in milliseconds.  For example, if the timer must expire
 * after 100 ticks, then xTimerPeriodInTicks should be set to 100.
 * Alternatively, if the timer must expire after 500ms, then xPeriod can be set
 * to ( 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS ) provided configTICK_RATE_HZ is less than or
 * equal to 1000.
 *
 * @param uxAutoReload If uxAutoReload is set to pdTRUE then the timer will
 * expire repeatedly with a frequency set by the xTimerPeriodInTicks parameter.
 * If uxAutoReload is set to pdFALSE then the timer will be a one-shot timer and
 * enter the dormant state after it expires.
 *
 * @param pvTimerID An identifier that is assigned to the timer being created.
 * Typically this would be used in the timer callback function to identify which
 * timer expired when the same callback function is assigned to more than one
 * timer.
 *
 * @param pxCallbackFunction The function to call when the timer expires.
 * Callback functions must have the prototype defined by TimerCallbackFunction_t,
 * which is	"void vCallbackFunction( TimerHandle_t xTimer );".
 *
 * @return If the timer is successfully created then a handle to the newly
 * created timer is returned.  If the timer cannot be created (because either
 * there is insufficient FreeRTOS heap remaining to allocate the timer
 * structures, or the timer period was set to 0) then NULL is returned.
 *

 *
 * // Define a callback function that will be used by multiple timer instances.
 * // The callback function does nothing but count the number of times the
 * // associated timer expires, and stop the timer once the timer has expired
 * // 10 times.
 * void vTimerCallback( TimerHandle_t pxTimer )

 *     lArrayIndex = ( int32_t ) pvTimerGetTimerID( pxTimer );
 *
 *     // Increment the number of times that pxTimer has expired.
 *     lExpireCounters[ lArrayIndex ] += 1;
 *
 *     // If the timer has expired 10 times then stop it from running.
 *     if( lExpireCounters[ lArrayIndex ] == xMaxExpiryCountBeforeStopping )

 * Used from application interrupt service routines to defer the execution of a
 * function to the RTOS daemon task (the timer service task, hence this function
 * is implemented in timers.c and is prefixed with 'Timer').
 *
 * Ideally an interrupt service routine (ISR) is kept as short as possible, but
 * sometimes an ISR either has a lot of processing to do, or needs to perform
 * processing that is not deterministic.  In these cases
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR() can be used to defer processing of a function
 * to the RTOS daemon task.
 *
 * A mechanism is provided that allows the interrupt to return directly to the
 * task that will subsequently execute the pended callback function.  This
 * allows the callback function to execute contiguously in time with the
 * interrupt - just as if the callback had executed in the interrupt itself.
 *
 * @param xFunctionToPend The function to execute from the timer service/
 * daemon task.  The function must conform to the PendedFunction_t
 * prototype.
 *
 * @param pvParameter1 The value of the callback function's first parameter.
 * The parameter has a void * type to allow it to be used to pass any type.
 * For example, unsigned longs can be cast to a void *, or the void * can be
 * used to point to a structure.
 *
 * @param ulParameter2 The value of the callback function's second parameter.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken As mentioned above, calling this function
 * will result in a message being sent to the timer daemon task.  If the
 * priority of the timer daemon task (which is set using
 * configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY in FreeRTOSConfig.h) is higher than the priority of
 * the currently running task (the task the interrupt interrupted) then
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken will be set to pdTRUE within
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR(), indicating that a context switch should be
 * requested before the interrupt exits.  For that reason
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken must be initialised to pdFALSE.  See the
 * example code below.
 *
 * @return pdPASS is returned if the message was successfully sent to the
 * timer daemon task, otherwise pdFALSE is returned.

 * Queue sets provide a mechanism to allow a task to block (pend) on a read
 * operation from multiple queues or semaphores simultaneously.
 *
 * See FreeRTOS/Source/Demo/Common/Minimal/QueueSet.c for an example using this
 * function.
 *
 * A queue set must be explicitly created using a call to xQueueCreateSet()
 * before it can be used.  Once created, standard FreeRTOS queues and semaphores
 * can be added to the set using calls to xQueueAddToSet().
 * xQueueSelectFromSet() is then used to determine which, if any, of the queues
 * or semaphores contained in the set is in a state where a queue read or
 * semaphore take operation would be successful.
 *
 * Note 1:  See the documentation on http://wwwFreeRTOS.org/RTOS-queue-sets.html
 * for reasons why queue sets are very rarely needed in practice as there are
 * simpler methods of blocking on multiple objects.
 *
 * Note 2:  Blocking on a queue set that contains a mutex will not cause the
 * mutex holder to inherit the priority of the blocked task.
 *
 * Note 3:  An additional 4 bytes of RAM is required for each space in a every
 * queue added to a queue set.  Therefore counting semaphores that have a high
 * maximum count value should not be added to a queue set.
 *
 * Note 4:  A receive (in the case of a queue) or take (in the case of a
 * semaphore) operation must not be performed on a member of a queue set unless
 * a call to xQueueSelectFromSet() has first returned a handle to that set member.
 *
 * @param uxEventQueueLength Queue sets store events that occur on
 * the queues and semaphores contained in the set.  uxEventQueueLength specifies
 * the maximum number of events that can be queued at once.  To be absolutely
 * certain that events are not lost uxEventQueueLength should be set to the
 * total sum of the length of the queues added to the set, where binary
 * semaphores and mutexes have a length of 1, and counting semaphores have a
 * length set by their maximum count value.  Examples:
 *  + If a queue set is to hold a queue of length 5, another queue of length 12,
 *    and a binary semaphore, then uxEventQueueLength should be set to
 *    (5 + 12 + 1), or 18.
 *  + If a queue set is to hold three binary semaphores then uxEventQueueLength
 *    should be set to (1 + 1 + 1 ), or 3.
 *  + If a queue set is to hold a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of
 *    5, and a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of 3, then
 *    uxEventQueueLength should be set to (5 + 3), or 8.

 *
 * Creates a new counting semaphore instance, and returns a handle by which the
 * new counting semaphore can be referenced.
 *
 * In many usage scenarios it is faster and more memory efficient to use a
 * direct to task notification in place of a counting semaphore!
 * http://www.freertos.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html
 *
 * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, counting semaphores use a
 * block of memory, in which the counting semaphore structure is stored.  If a
 * counting semaphore is created using xSemaphoreCreateCounting() then the
 * required memory is automatically dynamically allocated inside the
 * xSemaphoreCreateCounting() function.  (see
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a counting semaphore is created
 * using xSemaphoreCreateCountingStatic() then the application writer must
 * provide the memory.  xSemaphoreCreateCountingStatic() therefore allows a
 * counting semaphore to be created without using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * Counting semaphores are typically used for two things:
 *
 * 1) Counting events.
 *
 *    In this usage scenario an event handler will 'give' a semaphore each time
 *    an event occurs (incrementing the semaphore count value), and a handler
 *    task will 'take' a semaphore each time it processes an event
 *    (decrementing the semaphore count value).  The count value is therefore
 *    the difference between the number of events that have occurred and the
 *    number that have been processed.  In this case it is desirable for the
 *    initial count value to be zero.
 *
 * 2) Resource management.
 *
 *    In this usage scenario the count value indicates the number of resources
 *    available.  To obtain control of a resource a task must first obtain a
 *    semaphore - decrementing the semaphore count value.  When the count value
 *    reaches zero there are no free resources.  When a task finishes with the
 *    resource it 'gives' the semaphore back - incrementing the semaphore count
 *    value.  In this case it is desirable for the initial count value to be
 *    equal to the maximum count value, indicating that all resources are free.
 *
 * @param uxMaxCount The maximum count value that can be reached.  When the
 *        semaphore reaches this value it can no longer be 'given'.
 *
 * @param uxInitialCount The count value assigned to the semaphore when it is
 *        created.
 *
 * @param pxSemaphoreBuffer Must point to a variable of type StaticSemaphore_t,
 * which will then be used to hold the semaphore's data structure, removing the
 * need for the memory to be allocated dynamically.
 *
 * @return If the counting semaphore was successfully created then a handle to
 * the created counting semaphore is returned.  If pxSemaphoreBuffer was NULL
 * then NULL is returned.
 *
 * Example usage:
 <pre>
 SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore;
 StaticSemaphore_t xSemaphoreBuffer;

 void vATask( void * pvParameters )
 {
 SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore = NULL;

    // Counting semaphore cannot be used before they have been created.  Create

    // passed in and will be used to hold the semaphore structure, so no dynamic
    // memory allocation will be used.
    xSemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateCounting( 10, 0, &xSemaphoreBuffer );

/**
 * An event group is a collection of bits to which an application can assign a
 * meaning.  For example, an application may create an event group to convey
 * the status of various CAN bus related events in which bit 0 might mean "A CAN
 * message has been received and is ready for processing", bit 1 might mean "The
 * application has queued a message that is ready for sending onto the CAN
 * network", and bit 2 might mean "It is time to send a SYNC message onto the
 * CAN network" etc.  A task can then test the bit values to see which events
 * are active, and optionally enter the Blocked state to wait for a specified
 * bit or a group of specified bits to be active.  To continue the CAN bus
 * example, a CAN controlling task can enter the Blocked state (and therefore
 * not consume any processing time) until either bit 0, bit 1 or bit 2 are
 * active, at which time the bit that was actually active would inform the task
 * which action it had to take (process a received message, send a message, or
 * send a SYNC).
 *
 * The event groups implementation contains intelligence to avoid race
 * conditions that would otherwise occur were an application to use a simple
 * variable for the same purpose.  This is particularly important with respect
 * to when a bit within an event group is to be cleared, and when bits have to
 * be set and then tested atomically - as is the case where event groups are
 * used to create a synchronisation point between multiple tasks (a
 * 'rendezvous').

 *
 * @return The value of the event group at the time the call to

 * if setting a bit results in a task that was waiting for the bit leaving the
 * blocked state then it is possible the bit will be cleared automatically
 * (see the xClearBitOnExit parameter of xEventGroupWaitBits()).  Second, any
 * unblocked (or otherwise Ready state) task that has a priority above that of
 * the task that called xEventGroupSetBits() will execute and may change the
 * event group value before the call to xEventGroupSetBits() returns.

 *
 * A version of xEventGroupSetBits() that can be called from an interrupt.
 *
 * Setting bits in an event group is not a deterministic operation because there
 * are an unknown number of tasks that may be waiting for the bit or bits being
 * set.  FreeRTOS does not allow nondeterministic operations to be performed in
 * interrupts or from critical sections.  Therefore xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR()
 * sends a message to the timer task to have the set operation performed in the
 * context of the timer task - where a scheduler lock is used in place of a
 * critical section.
 *
 * @param xEventGroup The event group in which the bits are to be set.
 *
 * @param uxBitsToSet A bitwise value that indicates the bit or bits to set.
 * For example, to set bit 3 only, set uxBitsToSet to 0x08.  To set bit 3
 * and bit 0 set uxBitsToSet to 0x09.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken As mentioned above, calling this function
 * will result in a message being sent to the timer daemon task.  If the
 * priority of the timer daemon task is higher than the priority of the
 * currently running task (the task the interrupt interrupted) then
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken will be set to pdTRUE by
 * xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR(), indicating that a context switch should be
 * requested before the interrupt exits.  For that reason
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken must be initialised to pdFALSE.  See the
 * example code below.
 *
 * @return If the request to execute the function was posted successfully then
 * pdPASS is returned, otherwise pdFALSE is returned.  pdFALSE will be returned
 * if the timer service queue was full.
 *
 * Example usage:
   <pre>

 *

 *
 * This function cannot be used from an interrupt.

 * The function will return before its block time expires if the bits specified

/**
\page cmsis_os_h Header File Template: cmsis_os.h

The file \b cmsis_os.h is a template header file for a CMSIS-RTOS compliant Real-Time Operating System (RTOS).
Each RTOS that is compliant with CMSIS-RTOS shall provide a specific \b cmsis_os.h header file that represents
its implementation.

The file cmsis_os.h contains:
 - CMSIS-RTOS API function definitions
 - struct definitions for parameters and return types
 - status and priority values used by CMSIS-RTOS API functions
 - macros for defining threads and other kernel objects


<b>Name conventions and header file modifications</b>

All definitions are prefixed with \b os to give an unique name space for CMSIS-RTOS functions.
Definitions that are prefixed \b os_ are not used in the application code but local to this header file.
All definitions and functions that belong to a module are grouped and have a common prefix, i.e. \b osThread.

Definitions that are marked with <b>CAN BE CHANGED</b> can be adapted towards the needs of the actual CMSIS-RTOS implementation.
These definitions can be specific to the underlying RTOS kernel.

Definitions that are marked with <b>MUST REMAIN UNCHANGED</b> cannot be altered. Otherwise the CMSIS-RTOS implementation is no longer
compliant to the standard. Note that some functions are optional and need not to be provided by every CMSIS-RTOS implementation.


<b>Function calls from interrupt service routines</b>

The following CMSIS-RTOS functions can be called from threads and interrupt service routines (ISR):
  - \ref osSignalSet
  - \ref osSemaphoreRelease
  - \ref osPoolAlloc, \ref osPoolCAlloc, \ref osPoolFree
  - \ref osMessagePut, \ref osMessageGet
  - \ref osMailAlloc, \ref osMailCAlloc, \ref osMailGet, \ref osMailPut, \ref osMailFree

Functions that cannot be called from an ISR are verifying the interrupt status and return in case that they are called
from an ISR context the status code \b osErrorISR. In some implementations this condition might be caught using the HARD FAULT vector.

Some CMSIS-RTOS implementations support CMSIS-RTOS function calls from multiple ISR at the same time.
If this is impossible, the CMSIS-RTOS rejects calls by nested ISR functions with the status code \b osErrorISRRecursive.


<b>Define and reference object definitions</b>

With <b>\#define osObjectsExternal</b> objects are defined as external symbols. This allows to create a consistent header file
that is used throughout a project as shown below:

<i>Header File</i>
\code
#include <cmsis_os.h>                                         // CMSIS RTOS header file

// Thread definition
extern void thread_sample (void const *argument);             // function prototype
osThreadDef (thread_sample, osPriorityBelowNormal, 1, 100);

// Pool definition
osPoolDef(MyPool, 10, long);
\endcode


This header file defines all objects when included in a C/C++ source file. When <b>\#define osObjectsExternal</b> is
present before the header file, the objects are defined as external symbols. A single consistent header file can therefore be
used throughout the whole project.

<i>Example</i>
\code
#include "osObjects.h"     // Definition of the CMSIS-RTOS objects
\endcode

\code
#define osObjectExternal   // Objects will be defined as external symbols
#include "osObjects.h"     // Reference to the CMSIS-RTOS objects
\endcode

 * 
 * In the netconn implementation, there are three ways to block a client:
 * 
 * - accept mbox (sys_arch_mbox_fetch(&conn->acceptmbox, &accept_ptr, 0); in netconn_accept())
 * - receive mbox (sys_arch_mbox_fetch(&conn->recvmbox, &buf, 0); in netconn_recv_data())
 * - send queue is full (sys_arch_sem_wait(LWIP_API_MSG_SEM(msg), 0); in lwip_netconn_do_write())
 * 
 * The events have to be seen as events signaling the state of these mboxes/semaphores. For non-blocking
 * connections, you need to know in advance whether a call to a netconn function call would block or not,
 * and these events tell you about that.
 * 
 * RCVPLUS events say: Safe to perform a potentially blocking call call once more. 
 * They are counted in sockets - three RCVPLUS events for accept mbox means you are safe
 * to call netconn_accept 3 times without being blocked.
 * Same thing for receive mbox.
 * 
 * RCVMINUS events say: Your call to to a possibly blocking function is "acknowledged".
 * Socket implementation decrements the counter.
 * 
 * For TX, there is no need to count, its merely a flag. SENDPLUS means you may send something.
 * SENDPLUS occurs when enough data was delivered to peer so netconn_send() can be called again.
 * A SENDMINUS event occurs when the next call to a netconn_send() would be blocking.

/**
\page cmsis_os_h Header File Template: cmsis_os.h

The file \b cmsis_os.h is a template header file for a CMSIS-RTOS compliant Real-Time Operating System (RTOS).
Each RTOS that is compliant with CMSIS-RTOS shall provide a specific \b cmsis_os.h header file that represents
its implementation.

The file cmsis_os.h contains:
 - CMSIS-RTOS API function definitions
 - struct definitions for parameters and return types
 - status and priority values used by CMSIS-RTOS API functions
 - macros for defining threads and other kernel objects


<b>Name conventions and header file modifications</b>

All definitions are prefixed with \b os to give an unique name space for CMSIS-RTOS functions.
Definitions that are prefixed \b os_ are not used in the application code but local to this header file.
All definitions and functions that belong to a module are grouped and have a common prefix, i.e. \b osThread.

Definitions that are marked with <b>CAN BE CHANGED</b> can be adapted towards the needs of the actual CMSIS-RTOS implementation.
These definitions can be specific to the underlying RTOS kernel.

Definitions that are marked with <b>MUST REMAIN UNCHANGED</b> cannot be altered. Otherwise the CMSIS-RTOS implementation is no longer
compliant to the standard. Note that some functions are optional and need not to be provided by every CMSIS-RTOS implementation.


<b>Function calls from interrupt service routines</b>

The following CMSIS-RTOS functions can be called from threads and interrupt service routines (ISR):
  - \ref osSignalSet
  - \ref osSemaphoreRelease
  - \ref osPoolAlloc, \ref osPoolCAlloc, \ref osPoolFree
  - \ref osMessagePut, \ref osMessageGet
  - \ref osMailAlloc, \ref osMailCAlloc, \ref osMailGet, \ref osMailPut, \ref osMailFree

Functions that cannot be called from an ISR are verifying the interrupt status and return in case that they are called
from an ISR context the status code \b osErrorISR. In some implementations this condition might be caught using the HARD FAULT vector.

Some CMSIS-RTOS implementations support CMSIS-RTOS function calls from multiple ISR at the same time.
If this is impossible, the CMSIS-RTOS rejects calls by nested ISR functions with the status code \b osErrorISRRecursive.


<b>Define and reference object definitions</b>

With <b>\#define osObjectsExternal</b> objects are defined as external symbols. This allows to create a consistent header file
that is used throughout a project as shown below:

<i>Header File</i>
\code
#include <cmsis_os.h>                                         // CMSIS RTOS header file

// Thread definition
extern void thread_sample (void const *argument);             // function prototype
osThreadDef (thread_sample, osPriorityBelowNormal, 1, 100);

// Pool definition
osPoolDef(MyPool, 10, long);
\endcode


This header file defines all objects when included in a C/C++ source file. When <b>\#define osObjectsExternal</b> is
present before the header file, the objects are defined as external symbols. A single consistent header file can therefore be
used throughout the whole project.

<i>Example</i>
\code
#include "osObjects.h"     // Definition of the CMSIS-RTOS objects
\endcode

\code
#define osObjectExternal   // Objects will be defined as external symbols
#include "osObjects.h"     // Reference to the CMSIS-RTOS objects
\endcode
